## Pacman 0.5



![Pacman](https://i.ibb.co/F4Rk4Tq/Pacman.png)


[Pacman 0.5](https://github.com/superpaupaul/pacman_c) is a game created on the occasion of the UIT Pacman Project. The goal was to try to recreate the mythical game using only the C Programming language. For almost two months we have been trying to create our version of Pacman. At the end of the project we were able to design a pacman that was visually but somewhat lacking in fluidity. It’s with great pleasure that we present you our creation: Pacman 0.5

## Prerequisites
This project needs a graphical library which is called SDL in order to work. It is based for Debian systems and needs some dependencies. You can install those by typing:
`sudo apt install libsdl1.2debian libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-0 libsdl-ttf2.0-dev`
    
## How to use
The project does not need to be compiled, it has already been.
Once [downloaded](https://github.com/superpaupaul/pacman_c/archive/master.zip), the project folder will look like this:
| Item | Description |
| ------: | -----------: |
| BMP  | folder containing all the .bmp images needed |
| data | folder containing all the .txt levels, scores etc |
| lib    | folder containing the graphical library |
| obj    | folder containing the obj files |
| src    | folder containing the code |
| debug.sh | A script we have used to debug the program |
| makefile | The file used for compilation |
| start.sh | The script for starting the program |

---

In order to play you might want to set the start script as executable, so cd into the project folder and type `chmod +x start.sh`
Once this is done you’re good to go!
Just type `./start.sh`

## What is working ?
Even though this project was created by two **great** developers, it has some flaws due to time limits, but it is still ~~very~~ somehow playable. Here is what is working:
| Functionality | State |
| ------: | -----------: |
| menu | works |
| player movements | works |
| ghosts movements | works (almost) |
| pac-gums collecting| works |
| bonus collecting | works |
| end game | works |
| score writing | works |
| score viewing | works |
| game restart | not working |
